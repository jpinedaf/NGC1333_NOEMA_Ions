First resample make that the interferometric cubes have a common 
beam and grid. This also takes the C18O data and regrids them 
to this common grid, this includes the calculation of the 
integrated intensity and peak line intensity for C18O. 
This is achieved by running
    cd data
    python match_cubes.py

Now we run the calculation of the integrated intensity for the 
interferometric data and determine the rms and SNR map for each 
transition. This is achieved by running
    cd data
    python QA_TdV_maps.py

Now we estimate the opacity for all 3 lines involved in the 
calculations. This is done with 
    python estimate_tau_lines.py
