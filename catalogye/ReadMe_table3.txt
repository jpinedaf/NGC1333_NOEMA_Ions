Abstract:
    We present new Chandra X-ray data of the NGC 1333 embedded cluster and
    combine these data with existing Chandra data, Spitzer photometry, and
    ground-based spectroscopy of both the NGC 1333 and Serpens cloud core
    clusters to perform a detailed study of the X-ray properties of two of
    the nearest embedded clusters to the Sun. We first present new, deeper
    observations of NGC 1333 with Chandra ACIS-I and combine these with
    existing Spitzer observations of the region. In NGC 1333, a total of
    95 cluster members are detected in X-rays of which 54 were previously
    identified in the Spitzer data.

Description:
    We have obtained Spitzer images of the Serpens and NGC 1333 regions
    in six wavelength bands: the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0um bands of the
    Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the 24um and 70um bands of the
    Multi-band Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). The photometry
    extracted from these data was supplemented by J-, H-, and Ks-band
    photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) point-source
    catalog.

    The X-ray data were taken from the Chandra ANCHORS (AN archive of
    Chandra Observations of Regions of Star formation11) archive. The
    Serpens cluster was observed on 2004 June 19, OBSID 4479, with an
    88.45ks exposure time.

    The NGC 1333 data are newly published here, hence we describe the
    reduction of the NGC 1333 data in detail. NGC 1333 was observed in
    three epochs: OBSID 6436, a 36.95ks exposure on 2006 July 5, OBSID
    6437, a 40.12ks exposure on 2006 July 11, and OBSID 642, a 43.91ks
    exposure on 2000 July 12, giving a total exposure time of 120.98ks.
